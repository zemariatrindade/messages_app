2024-01-17 11:46:23,3ca2e7c3-cb9f-4d58-a688-9170ff1917a6,"I had high hopes for this place since the burgers are cooked over a charcoal grill, but unfortunately the taste fell flat, way flat."
2024-01-03 10:06:07,eaacdfa5-6aca-4574-898f-68f1068f5080,I could eat their bruschetta all day it is devine.
2024-01-12 09:13:15,62990973-28ab-41de-aea5-cbdca6c7eb9a,Not a single employee came out to see if we were OK or even needed a water refill once they finally served us our food.
2024-01-10 19:30:37,bf1075ee-a7f9-43cf-9424-8523b028fc46,"Lastly, the mozzarella sticks, they were the best thing we ordered."
2024-01-19 14:57:17,65c7d4e3-6575-4fa8-a595-61107c483092,"The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was."
2024-01-03 22:49:01,c5de6e71-4bba-43b3-8d95-c079d38ab593,The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!
2024-01-04 21:54:41,ffbf6b4c-4628-4604-ae85-ea0aa3b0c0af,The service was terrible though.
2024-01-03 03:38:11,451b2bbb-a9e2-4821-a18f-d3f26b5b980b,"This place is overpriced, not consistent with their boba, and it really is OVERPRICED!"

2024-01-06 21:05:47,37ff188f-76f5-4420-b01e-24231ff185d3,The food was terrible.
2024-01-19 17:00:29,9d930148-7995-4039-807a-da7969a2599d,The seasonal fruit was fresh white peach puree.
2024-01-04 22:11:08,7aba9be1-0793-4f75-b042-b17ade931125,It kept getting worse and worse so now I'm officially done.
2024-01-12 15:02:50,5f02e00c-2197-4f3e-bbbb-7d12fff7059d,This place should honestly be blown up.
2024-01-17 07:20:25,abf44616-e63e-4ea5-b97f-4b4e2ecb1a09,But I definitely would not eat here again.
2024-01-18 23:44:41,62943f44-f686-41dc-9968-4c29114aa1a5,Do not waste your money here!
2024-01-09 01:19:20,f601617f-d821-43b0-99e1-b61501b2b39e,I love that they put their food in nice plastic containers as opposed to cramming it in little paper takeout boxes.
2024-01-16 05:16:14,24ee2f49-dea4-439a-9637-9343ace65939,The crêpe was delicate and thin and moist.
2024-01-18 21:35:18,854eb6a9-e869-4a37-a27d-928e4d9328ee,Awful service.

2024-01-19 02:35:58,e8f3b1e1-6598-4980-a6f3-1ddb774caed3,Food quality has been horrible.
2024-01-02 01:03:17,3ed94bd5-6272-4532-8f44-23764922a3da,For that price I can think of a few place I would have much rather gone.
2024-01-13 13:45:51,defb35ab-b12c-4a6f-b6ba-36f78e7601ed,The service here is fair at best.
2024-01-07 05:10:32,4dd1e1cf-5cf6-4a10-b66d-0829f3d10609,"I do love sushi, but I found Kabuki to be over-priced, over-hip and under-services."
2024-01-12 17:58:38,ee63953d-b191-4204-87a3-5bc0a67094b7,Do yourself a favor and stay away from this dish.
2024-01-10 09:10:57,30709463-2ac5-49a8-8d55-ffa3425f4139,Very poor service.
2024-01-02 19:18:15,1193483e-6fdd-4d74-8553-c74176acef35,No one at the table thought the food was above average or worth the wait that we had for it.
2024-01-04 16:35:28,b020fa7c-f5a7-40c5-b1b6-55bfdce6a273,"Best service and food ever, Maria our server was so good and friendly she made our day."
2024-01-12 09:11:15,2bde1cc8-c9fe-4bff-bd63-ce1453114d81,They were excellent.
2024-01-09 15:32:56,4cbfce42-6c32-4f6d-91ae-8b94be74590a,I paid the bill but did not tip because I felt the server did a terrible job.
2024-01-14 09:08:52,bc4d7752-099e-458e-bec2-0b9e14e31f3f,Just had lunch here and had a great experience.
2024-01-01 21:15:33,63ffc7e6-add6-4014-a133-6dc010584abd,I have never had such bland food which surprised me considering the article we read focused so much on their spices and flavor.
2024-01-15 10:28:15,aa333aed-e0d3-4e49-99e4-be7e72a41487,Food is way overpriced and portions are fucking small.
2024-01-03 05:29:04,c6864bef-2578-490a-a777-c3d7c68a2f9b,I recently tried Caballero's and I have been back every week since!
2024-01-03 23:47:17,a9138a03-394f-4f91-8147-dd63d304d2cd,"for 40 bucks a head, i really expect better food."
2024-01-16 01:59:19,d0d4de96-73ed-41a7-affa-47ecf81b3a0d,The food came out at a good pace.
2024-01-07 22:27:44,24618a98-5d22-4f58-90e5-30a8b50b46ab,"I ate there twice on my last visit, and especially enjoyed the salmon salad."
2024-01-19 21:33:45,7bae012c-b9a3-45d8-923b-6452b18200c0,I won't be back.
2024-01-08 12:59:58,8e986354-6ae6-49f3-a489-38d70d32de90,We could not believe how dirty the oysters were!
2024-01-08 08:31:36,d0bdc9d3-2388-406a-8e0c-92043d7a6508,This place deserves no stars.
2024-01-03 17:43:27,d30c2846-7d8e-41a1-9765-a6fb48798592,I would not recommend this place.
2024-01-11 23:37:40,c6e852aa-16b2-420b-a6b1-689b89c9f1bc,"In fact I'm going to round up to 4 stars, just because she was so awesome."
2024-01-12 17:24:33,ff5de7f4-bd9a-4ca3-8e5a-abc5a819595a,"To my disbelief, each dish qualified as the worst version of these foods I have ever tasted."
2024-01-13 07:15:04,764323e1-600c-45ef-910c-ae92aabc1554,"Bad day or not, I have a very low tolerance for rude customer service people, it is your job to be nice and polite, wash dishes otherwise!!"
2024-01-18 05:36:25,b360263d-b14a-44b7-a81d-c4fdd108f4fe,the potatoes were great and so was the biscuit.
2024-01-14 19:54:51,63bb183e-cbc1-43fc-b3c3-db281938efef,I probably would not go here again.
2024-01-11 10:47:26,01c0794f-060b-48e5-8809-efbf58a4fff4,So flavorful and has just the perfect amount of heat.

2024-01-11 12:00:56,6ebf6465-b8b9-4a03-b8ae-376244704743,The feel of the dining room was more college cooking course than high class dining and the service was slow at best.
2024-01-03 13:22:30,7b0cb69d-6e11-4571-9f99-2467e7de75bc,"I started this review with two stars, but I'm editing it to give it only one."

2024-01-19 18:51:17,dbd6052b-e9ff-4810-bdf0-c71489ea9918,Probably not in a hurry to go back.

2024-01-07 07:34:26,11a3be46-cf55-418a-bbad-59bfc54c7fb1,The only reason to eat here would be to fill up before a night of binge drinking just to get some carbs in your stomach.
2024-01-01 19:57:29,16066220-1ee9-4911-831c-83202a9ab094,"Insults, profound deuchebaggery, and had to go outside for a smoke break while serving just to solidify it."

2024-01-15 05:06:37,86d6f246-262e-4470-b7e9-2e9c91690cc7,The ambiance isn't much better.
2024-01-06 10:40:13,917988ba-abd7-4235-b3d8-8dd19c96b18b,"Unfortunately, it only set us up for disapppointment with our entrees."

2024-01-17 12:13:53,588bb1e4-9b19-40c6-bdf9-ff036c7e0afd,The problem I have is that they charge $11.99 for a sandwich that is no bigger than a Subway sub (which offers better and more amount of vegetables).
2024-01-04 03:13:34,61a2aab3-8d24-4f6d-a733-e3e4eda59b38,Shrimp- When I unwrapped it (I live only 1/2 a mile from Brushfire) it was literally ice cold.

2024-01-10 04:42:13,bc3696c8-750d-4bcb-8294-667500ab875f,"The whole experience was underwhelming, and I think we'll just go to Ninja Sushi next time."
2024-01-15 08:37:42,76b992c7-fd03-4435-83da-7b1c2c6733b7,"Then, as if I hadn't wasted enough of my life there, they poured salt in the wound by drawing out the time it took to bring the check."
